# DESCRIPTION
This project implements an Image Classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed in PyTorch. Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision where the goal is to assign a label to an input image from a fixed set of categories. In this case, we use the FashionMNIST dataset — a widely-used benchmark dataset consisting of grayscale images of clothing items, such as shirts, trousers, and shoes.

The goal of this project is to build a functional CNN that can correctly classify images into one of ten predefined clothing categories. The project involves designing the network architecture, training the model, evaluating performance, and visualizing predictions.

# RESULTS
This project demonstrates a hands-on implementation of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch. It covers all the essential steps from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization. The results highlight CNN’s effectiveness in handling visual data and its potential use in various real-world applications like product recognition, medical imaging, and face detection.
